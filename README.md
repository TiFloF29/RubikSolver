# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Why this project ?

I am pretty sure there are quite a lot of Rubik's Cube solver. My goal is not to bring a revolutionary new tool, but to learn Python doing it without using existing Python cube solvers like [RubikOptimal](https://pypi.org/project/RubikOptimal/) or [rubik-solver](https://pypi.org/project/rubik-solver/).

I hope this project will evolve towards a camera-based solution to avoid entering manually all the colors.
